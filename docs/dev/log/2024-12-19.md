Today I'll try to [blinky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9wvA_S6m7Y):
[blinky](hello-worldblinky.md). After that I'll try to do it again with embassy.

From the
[example](https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy/tree/main/examples/stm32f4), it
looks like `embassy` doesn't replace the `cortex-m` crates, it just adds
convenience functions and ergonomics to it.

I stole some other options from the example's `Cargo.toml` file too like
`panic-probe` and `defmt`.

> Panic-Probe is a Rust crate that enables `probe-run`, a tool for running
> embedded Rust applications like native applications. It provides a panic
> handler for `probe-run`, allowing you to write integration tests that run on
> your embedded device via `cargo test`.

and

> `defmt` ("de format", short for "deferred formatting") is a highly efficient
> logging framework that targets resource-constrained devices, like
> microcontrollers. `println!`-like formatting, multiple logging levels,
> compile-time `RUST_LOG`-like filtering of logs, and timestamped logs.

When compiling, I'm finding that something about `embassy-time` is causing the
build to fail. I can successfully compile and build an embassy script without
`embassy-time` but any time I import a timer, it fails to compile. I might be
able to get around this by using `use embassy::time::{Duration, Timer};`.

Hm, a search engine AI says
> Undefined symbol _embassy_time_schedule_wake: The linker error occurs when
> trying to link the embassy_time crate with the generic-queue feature enabled.
> The error message indicates that there are multiple definitions of the
> _embassy_time_schedule_wake symbol.

And in that github issue I think I found some breadcrumbs toward a
[solution](https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy/issues/1109#issuecomment-1346256031).

> To use timers, some backend must be provided through crate features â€“
> otherwise, linking will fail and complain about a missing
> `_embassy_time_schedule_wake` symbol.

> Possible backends are:

> - (Something for ESP?)
> - The `generic-queue` feature of the embassy-time crate. Use this if you use
>   multiple executors, or one not listed above.

This didn't work alone, but I was able to get it to build once I added the
`time-driver-tim4` and `time` features to the `embassy-stm32` crate alongside
the `integrated-timers` feature in `embassy-executor`.

I ran into another issue when trying to reflash the board.

It looks very similar to the issue described
[here](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/probe-rs-fails-to-work-after-first-time-use-successful/103234/4)
which was resolved by adding `--connect-under-reset` to the `probe-rs` command.
After adding this option, flashing has been reliably working.

I also confirmed that embassy with the `memory-x` feature does indeed let us
delete the `memory.x` file from our repo and ignore it from the build process!
