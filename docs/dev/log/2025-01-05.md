I started using [Obsidian](obsidian.md) to write the docs and captain's log notes and wow I think this will make things a lot smoother. I don't plan to use obsidian tools for publishing the docs, for that we'll keep using mdBook. _It's all markdown!_

The main features I think I'm going to be using the most are
- Backlinks and automatic doc link updating
- Daily notes (to automate the captain's log)
- Templates

I see the daily notes as "source notes" for a zettlekasten. Also a great way to capture notes from youtube videos and other learning materials. The files that make it into true "docs" published in the book will live elsewhere. Only the docs included in [SUMMARY](../../src/SUMMARY.md) will actually be published. The rest will be in the repo but I won't have to worry about formatting or making it look nice. I'm imagining the summary page to be like the curated notes I make after distilling the source notes.

One think am really interested in working on is the sensor emulation with microcontrollers. I don't think it's the most important thing to work on next, though. I am going to stay in the "broad strokes" land and maybe break it up into smaller projects that I can finish ðŸ™ƒ --- wait, duh I already did this [system-sketch](../../src/design/system-sketch.md)

I might use this plugin instead of the [SUMMARY](../../src/SUMMARY.md) though, as it's
getting rather tedious to update.

 Neither worked out very well nor have they been updated in ages. Oh well.
