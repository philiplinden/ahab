I started using [Obsidian](obsidian.md) to write the docs and captain's log notes and wow I think this will make things a lot smoother. I don't plan to use obsidian tools for publishing the docs, for that we'll keep using mdBook. _It's all markdown!_

The main features I think I'm going to be using the most are
- Backlinks and automatic doc link updating
- Daily notes (to automate the captain's log)
- Templates

I see the daily notes as "source notes" for a zettlekasten. Also a great way to capture notes from youtube videos and other learning materials. The files that make it into true "docs" published in the book will live elsewhere. Only the docs included in [SUMMARY](../SUMMARY.md) will actually be published. The rest will be in the repo but I won't have to worry about formatting or making it look nice. I'm imagining the summary page to be like the curated notes I make after distilling the source notes.
