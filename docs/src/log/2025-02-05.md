Thinking about HWIL simulation, the "outside world" simulations should be a server.
- The world must maintain continuity across all of the entities "within" it.
- It is easier (in theory) to build out emulators that interact with a server than it is to try to implement every emulator in the simulator itself. It helps to separate the concerns: emulators focus on translating data from the simulation to and from hardware-like data, and the simulator can focus on being physically accurate.
- It is better (in theory) if the world persists beyond the emulators and tests.
