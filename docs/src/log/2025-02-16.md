I might transition this project from a high altitude balloon to a submersible.
- Drag, buoyancy, and weight are still the primary force components as with the hab.
- The majority of my tooling built for `yahs` can be reused.
- Fluid flow is simplified by water being incompressible unlike air and helium.
- I can rapidly iterate and test because I have a pool.
- I can work with wired comms in the beginning with a tether before embarking on wireless comms.
- No need to buy a balloon or helium. Just electronics and 3d printed parts.
- Much lower risk of catastrophic failure, especially because iterative testing is available in ways  it is not on a hab.
- Mission life can be a lot longer because floating on the surface (dead float) is an option.
- The `ahab` project name is still applicable!
	- Or I can name the missions and test tools `ahab` and name the submersible `moby`.
