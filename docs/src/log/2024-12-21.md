Renamed the `stm32` directory to `hello-world`.

I did some more thinking about the performance considerations of the RPi Zero,
MSP432, and STM32F411xx. The MSP432 is the most power-efficient at idle, but I'm
not expecting to operate the balloon for weeks at idle. The STM32 board is a bit
faster and more power-efficient than the RPi Zero, but not as efficient as the
MSP432. The RPi Zero is the fastest and least power-efficient of the three, but
it is far more flexible and capable than the other two. If I want to do imaging,
the RPi Zero is the only realistic option due to compute and memory. If I leave
out imaging, the STM32 is plenty. The dev board for the STM32F411VE comes with
handy sensors that will be useful to me too. In the end, I think I'll use the
STM32F411VE for flight and the RPi Zero for ground station.

I'm not sure how radio factors into this yet. Maybe the RPi Zero will be
necessary for radio and I can fly them as a pair. I have a full size Pi 4B
sitting around that I could use for ground station.

The [Nucleus](https://github.com/Brickworks/Nucleus) HAB used a Pi 4 compute
module as the main computer, so using a Pi for flight might be a good idea if I
want to continue that project someday.

Turns out I have the MB1115B variant, which uses
