I discovered some [mkdocs plugins](https://github.com/mkdocs/catalog) that make working in Obsidian for documentation easier and more natural: [Publisher for MkDocs - obsidian](https://github.com/mkdocs-publisher/mkdocs-publisher) `mkdocs-publisher`

There is some merit to a pure Rust approach, but it's starting to get in the way. It is common and natural to use Python for supporting tools.

Nevermind, turns out it's not as easy to set up as i thought. mdBook was working pretty well, so I'll stick to that. Maybe there is an Obsidian plugin for mdBook... [there is!](https://github.com/GeckoEidechse/mdbook-obsidian) but it's very immature.
