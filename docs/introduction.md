# what I want out of this

## what's in my drawer

I want to start with what's in my drawer, so there's not a lot to choose from.

- rpi 4b
- rpi zero w 1.1
- msp432
- stm32F411e

- a TTL camera

## rust everywhere

I want to use Rust for the software and firmware. Embedded Rust is an
interesting area and evolving quickly. I want to learn it. I really enjoy
working in Rust and the Cargo toolchain is incredible.

## everything in the loop

I want to develop the software and firmware with tests that can be run directly
on the hardware with everything in the loop. I want to be able to test the
software with "fake" inputs and outputs that react as I expect them to in real
life. The goal is to have everything working on my desk and then have everything
run exactly the same way when it's time for flight.
